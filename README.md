## 2.Recognizing Handwritten Digits with scikit-learn
The primary aim of this project involves predicting a numeric value, and then reading and interpreting an image that uses a handwritten font. we will have an estimator with the task of learning through a fit() function, and once it has reached a degree of predictive capability (a model sufficiently valid), it will produce a prediction with the predict() function.
